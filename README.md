Introduction
------------
Appirater is a class that you can drop into any iPhone app (iOS 4.0 or later) that will help remind your users
to review your app on the App Store. The code is released under the MIT/X11, so feel free to
modify and share your changes with the world. Read on below for how to get started. If you need any help using, 
the library check out the [Appirater group] [appiratergroup].


Getting Started
---------------

###Cocoapods
If you're new to Cocoapods [watch this](http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/5-cocoapods). To add Appirater to your app, add `pod "Appirater"` to your Podfile.

Cocoapods support is still experimental, and might not work in all use cases. If you experience problems, open an issue and install via Git submodule

###Git submodule
1. Add the Appirater code into your project.
2. If your project doesn't use ARC, add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to `Appirater.m` in your target's Build Phases » Compile Sources section.
3. Add the `CFNetwork`, `SystemConfiguration`, and `StoreKit` frameworks to your project. Be sure to **change Required to Optional** for StoreKit in your target's Build Phases » Link Binary with Libraries section.

Configuration
-------------
1. Appirater provides class methods to configure its behavior. See [`Appirater.h`] [Appirater.h] for more information.

```objc
[Appirater setAppId:@"552035781"];
[Appirater setDaysUntilPrompt:1];
[Appirater setUsesUntilPrompt:10];
[Appirater setSignificantEventsUntilPrompt:-1];
[Appirater setTimeBeforeReminding:2];
[Appirater setDebug:YES];
```

2. Call `[Appirater setAppId:@"yourAppId"]` with the app id provided by Apple. A good place to do this is at the beginning of your app delegate's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method.
3. Call `[Appirater appLaunched:YES]` at the end of your app delegate's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method.
4. Call `[Appirater appEnteredForeground:YES]` in your app delegate's `applicationWillEnterForeground:` method.
5. (OPTIONAL) Call `[Appirater userDidSignificantEvent:YES]` when the user does something 'significant' in the app.

###Development
Setting `[Appirater setDebug:YES]` will ensure that the rating request is shown each time the app is launched.

###Production
Make sure you set `[Appirater setDebug:NO]` to ensure the request is not shown every time the app is launched. Also make sure that each of these components are set in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method.

This example states that the rating request is only shown when the app has been launched 5 times **and** after 7 days.

```objc
[Appirater setAppId:@"770699556"];
[Appirater setDaysUntilPrompt:7];
[Appirater setUsesUntilPrompt:5];
[Appirater setSignificantEventsUntilPrompt:-1];
[Appirater setTimeBeforeReminding:2];
[Appirater setDebug:NO];
[Appirater appLaunched:YES];
```

If you wanted to show the request after 5 days only you can set the following:

```objc
[Appirater setAppId:@"770699556"];
[Appirater setDaysUntilPrompt:-1];
[Appirater setUsesUntilPrompt:5];
[Appirater setSignificantEventsUntilPrompt:-1];
[Appirater setTimeBeforeReminding:2];
[Appirater setDebug:NO];
[Appirater appLaunched:YES];
```

Help and Support Group

Requests for help, questions about usage, suggestions and other relevant topics should be posted at the [Appirater group] [appiratergroup]. As much as I'd like to help everyone who emails me, I can't respond to private emails, but I'll respond to posts on the group where others can benefit from the Q&As.

Ports for other SDKs
--------------
A few people have ported Appirater to other SDKs. The ports are listed here in hopes that they may assist developers of those SDKs. I don't know how closesly (if at all) they track the Objective-C version of Appirater. If you need support for any of the libraries, please contact the maintainer of the port.
